For the sequencer programming
We use pyserial library to communicate with the board. To record or replay, must use the python program to monitor the RP2040 behave.

The python program will ask user to select record mode or replay mode
If user select record mode, the python program will collect the register value information send from the RP2040(which is set in the RP2040 program), 
then the python program will print these information to a external txt file so that the record function is realized.

If user select replay mode, the python will read the record and send to the RP2040 through the serial port. The RP2040 will receive the message from PC
and write certain command into the register. In this way, we can successfully replay the command record
